# IBM Bob B2B Lead Intelligence Generator

This skill provides a complete workflow for generating deep, multi-level B2B lead intelligence databases specifically tailored for selling IBM Automation solutions (Turbonomic, Apptio, CP4I, watsonx, Verify) and ISV partners (e.g., Generate for Hospitals).

## Operating Modes

Before beginning, determine the appropriate mode based on the user's request:

1. **`new-account`**** Mode**: Use when the user provides a new list of target accounts or uploaded context documents. Focuses on initial ingestion and high-level C-suite mapping.

1. **`territory-filter`**** Mode**: Use when the user asks to filter an existing list by geography (e.g., "only Southeast territory"). Requires removing out-of-bounds accounts and rebuilding the database.

1. **`full-deep-analysis`**** Mode**: Use when the user requests "full deep analysis" or asks to find leads below the C-suite (VPs, Directors, Managers, Team Leads). Requires extensive parallel research across all organizational levels.

## The Workflow

Follow these steps sequentially based on the selected mode.

### Step 1: Context Ingestion (All Modes)

If the user uploads documents (e.g., Account Plans, ISV Enablement PDFs), read them thoroughly to extract account context, existing IBM footprint, and specific pain points.*Save key findings to a markdown file immediately to prevent context loss.*

### Step 2: Deep Parallel Research

Use the `map` tool to conduct parallel research on the target accounts.

**For ****`new-account`**** Mode:** Focus on C-suite and SVPs.**For ****`full-deep-analysis`**** Mode:** You MUST research all levels: C-Suite, SVPs, VPs, Directors, Managers, and Team Leads across IT, Finance, Clinical, Operations, Digital/AI, and Security departments.

*Research Requirements:*

- Identify named decision-makers and their exact titles.

- Identify specific account pain points (e.g., Epic on AWS cloud costs, M&A integration).

- Map pain points to IBM Solutions. See `references/ibm_automation_solutions.md` for the mapping guide.

### Step 3: Database Construction

Consolidate the research JSON output and build the master Excel workbook.

1. Write a Python script to build the Excel file. You can use or adapt the provided script:`python3 /home/ubuntu/skills/ibm-bob-lead-intelligence/scripts/build_excel_database.py <input_json> <output_excel>`

1. Ensure the workbook includes tabs for: Executive Dashboard, Master Lead Database, and Outreach Templates.

### Step 4: Executive Summary Generation

Create a strategic markdown playbook summarizing the findings.

1. Use the template provided at `templates/executive_summary.md`.

1. Calculate conservative 3-year TCV (Total Contract Value) pipeline estimates.

1. Highlight specific "Give-to-Get" offers (e.g., Complimentary Cloud Cost Assessment).

1. If healthcare accounts are included, you MUST include the "Generate for Hospitals" ISV play.

### Step 5: Deliverable Delivery

Deliver both the Excel workbook and the Markdown executive summary to the user via the `message` tool.

## Outreach Best Practices (Apply to Templates)

When generating outreach templates in the Excel file, adhere to these principles:

- **Consultative Tone:** Frame the message from a helpful perspective, emphasizing end-user value rather than a direct sales pitch.

- **Personalization:** Incorporate at least one personalization factor (public, private, personal, or professional connection).

- **Follow-up Protocol:** Explicitly state a 5-day follow-up plan (e.g., via email/call) if there is no immediate response.
