# BobLore Skill

Generate IBM Project Bob branded LinkedIn posts across four archetypes. All posts follow the canonical two-line format with hashtag and URL.

## Canonical Post Format

Every post MUST follow this exact structure — no exceptions:

```
{SETUP_LINE_1}
{SETUP_LINE_2}

#{HASHTAG}

https://lnkd.in/eS9uw5qt
```

**Example (the gold standard ):**

```
You hire a senior COBOL developer.
Day one, they call it "Cobalt."

#ShouldveGotBOB

https://lnkd.in/eS9uw5qt
```

Rules:

- Exactly **two setup lines** — scene-setter and punchline/consequence.

- Blank line between setup and hashtag. Blank line between hashtag and URL.

- URL is always `https://lnkd.in/eS9uw5qt`.

- Hashtag casing: `#ShouldveGotBOB`, `#HeUsesBOB`, `#SheUsesBOB`, `#HeIsBOB`.

## The Four Archetypes

| Archetype | Hashtag | Voice | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pain Point | `#ShouldveGotBOB` | Dry, deadpan corporate tragedy | Enterprise software failures that Bob would have prevented |
| Legendary Developer (male ) | `#HeUsesBOB` | Mythological, Chuck Norris-style | Superhuman male developer whose powers are amplified by Bob |
| Legendary Developer (female) | `#SheUsesBOB` | Mythological, Chuck Norris-style | Superhuman female developer whose powers are amplified by Bob |
| Bob Personified | `#HeIsBOB` | Reverent, transcendent | Bob himself as a legendary AI entity beyond category |

For full examples, voice rules, and pain-point taxonomy for each archetype, read:`/home/ubuntu/skills/boblore/references/boblore_library.md`

## Workflow

### Option A: Use the Generation Script (Recommended for Batches)

```bash
# Generate 5 #ShouldveGotBOB posts
python /home/ubuntu/skills/boblore/scripts/generate_posts.py --archetype shouldvegotbob --count 5

# Generate 3 posts focused on a specific topic
python /home/ubuntu/skills/boblore/scripts/generate_posts.py --archetype shouldvegotbob --topic "cloud migration" --count 3

# Generate posts for all archetypes
python /home/ubuntu/skills/boblore/scripts/generate_posts.py --archetype all --count 5

# Available archetypes: shouldvegotbob | heusesbob | sheusesbob | heisbob | all
```

The script outputs fully formatted posts, separated by `---`, ready to copy-paste to LinkedIn.

### Option B: Write Manually (For Single Posts or Custom Requests)

1. Read `boblore_library.md` to select the right archetype and draw from the pain-point or skill-domain taxonomy.

1. Write exactly two lines following the voice rules for the chosen archetype.

1. Apply the canonical format: two lines, blank line, hashtag, blank line, URL.

## Quality Standards

- **Specificity over generality.** "Your app crashed" is weak. "Your app crashes if the user's name contains a vowel" is BobLore.

- **Absurd but plausible.** The punchline should feel like something that could actually happen in enterprise software, taken one step further.

- **Never mention competitors.** Only IBM Project Bob exists in the BobLore universe.

- **Rotate gender** between `#HeUsesBOB` and `#SheUsesBOB` for inclusivity.

- **BOB is always capitalized** in hashtags.
